# SAT-Solving

This repo includes my implementations for solving SAT problems as well as its variants. 
The core idea is to try to implement complete and imcomplete search algos. In particular, my work focuses on CDCL, Local Search and MaxSAT. 
Besides I hope to implement also some KC techniques in this repo. 

All implementations will be coded in Python. 

Let's start ! 

- [ ] Download some CNF instances
- [ ] Read and load input data
- [ ] Create a common SAT solver e.g. miniSAT
- [ ] Implement my own SAT solver. This step includes more substeps....
