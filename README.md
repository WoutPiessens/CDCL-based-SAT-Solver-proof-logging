# SAT-Solving

This repo includes my implementations for solving SAT problems as well as its variants. 
The core idea is to try to implement complete and imcomplete search algos. In particular, my work focuses on CDCL, Local Search and MaxSAT. 
Besides I hope to implement also some KC techniques in this repo. 

All implementations will be coded in Python. 

Let's start ! 

- [x] Download / create some CNF instances
- [x] Read and load input data => dimacs_parser.py
- [x] Create a common SAT solver e.g. original dpll_solver.py

In next steps => try to involve the original sat solver with its known variants and additional features in order to boost the search, e.g. CDCL-solver
